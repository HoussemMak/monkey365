  "description": "Consider to isolate the Microsoft Entra ID B2B collaboration feature and investigate who can invite guests. By default, all users and guests in an Azure directory can invite guests even if they're not assigned to an administrator role.",
  "rationale": "Restricting invitations to users with specific administrator roles ensures that only authorised accounts have access to cloud resources. This helps to maintain `Need to Know` permissions and prevents inadvertent access to data.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tBy default the setting `Guest invite restrictions` is set to `Anyone in the organization can invite guest users including guests and non-admins`. This would allow anyone within the organisation to invite guests and non-admins to the tenant, posing a security risk.\r\n\t",
  "impact": "\r\n\t\t\t\tWith the option of Only users assigned to specific admin roles can invite guest users selected, users with specific admin roles will be in charge of sending invitations to the Azure Workspace, requiring additional overhead by them to manage user accounts. This will mean coordinating with other departments as they are onboarding new users, and manually removing access from users who no longer need it.",
  "remediation": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t###### From Azure Console\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Go to `Microsoft Entra ID`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Go to `External Identities`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Go to `External collaboration` settings\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4. Under `Guest invite settings`, for `Guest invite restrictions`, ensure that that `Only users assigned to specific admin roles can invite guest users` is selected\r\n\t",
