  "description": "Enable multi-factor authentication for all user credentials who have write access to Azure resources. These include roles like:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t* Service Co-Administrators\r\n\t\t\t\t\t* Subscription Owners\r\n\t\t\t\t\t* Contributors\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",
  "rationale": "Multi-factor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.",
  "impact": "Users would require two forms of authentication before any action is granted. Also, this requires an overhead for managing dual forms of authentication.",
  "remediation": "Follow Microsoft Azure documentation and setup multi-factor authentication in your environment.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t<a class='external-link' href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-azure-mfa' target='_blank'>Secure user sign-in events with Microsoft Entra ID Multi-Factor Authentication</a>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t",
