  "description": "Consider to set Exchange Online mail transport rules to not forward email to domains outside of your organization.",
  "rationale": "Attackers often create these rules to exfiltrate data from your tenancy.",
  "impact": "Care should be taken before implementation to ensure there is no business need for case-by-case auto-forwarding. Disabling auto-forwarding to remote domains will affect all users and in an organization.",
  "remediation": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t###### To alter the mail transport rules so they do not forward email to external domains, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Select `Exchange`.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Select `Mail Flow` and `Rules`.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. For each rule that forwards email to external domains, select the rule and click the *Delete* icon.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t###### To perform remediation you may also use the Exchange Online PowerShell Module\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Connect to Exchange Online using `Connect-ExchangeOnline`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Run the following PowerShell command:\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t```powershell\r\n\t\t\t\t\tRemove-TransportRule {RuleName}\r\n\t\t\t\t\t```\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. To verify this worked you may re-run the audit command as follows:\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t```powershell\r\n\t\t\t\t\tGet-TransportRule | Where-Object {$null -ne $_.RedirectMessageTo} | ft Name,RedirectMessageTo\r\n\t\t\t\t\t```\r\n\t",
