    "impact":  "Care should be taken before implementation to ensure there is no business need for case-by-case auto-forwarding. Disabling auto-forwarding to remote domains will affect all users and in an organization.",
    "remediation":  '
					###### To alter the mail transport rules so they do not forward email to external domains, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center
					1. Select `Exchange`.
					2. Select `Mail Flow` and `Rules`.
					3. For each rule that forwards email to external domains, select the rule and click the *Delete* icon.
					
					###### To perform remediation you may also use the Exchange Online PowerShell Module
					1. Connect to Exchange Online using `Connect-ExchangeOnline`
					2. Run the following PowerShell command:					
					```powershell
					Remove-TransportRule {RuleName}
					```
					3. To verify this worked you may re-run the audit command as follows:					
					```powershell
					Get-TransportRule | Where-Object {$null -ne $_.RedirectMessageTo} | ft Name,RedirectMessageTo
					```
