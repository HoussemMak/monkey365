  "rationale": "In the event that an attacker gains control of an end-user account they could create rules to ex-filtrate data from your environment.",
  "impact": "Care should be taken before implementation to ensure there is no business need for case-by-case auto-forwarding. Disabling auto-forwarding to remote domains will affect all users and in an organization.",
  "remediation": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t###### To perform remediation you may use the Exchange Online PowerShell Module:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Connect to Exchange Online using `Connect-ExchangeOnline`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Run the following PowerShell command:\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t```powershell\r\n\t\t\t\t\tSet-RemoteDomain Default -AutoForwardEnabled $false\r\n\t\t\t\t\t```\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3.
