  "description": "Consider to enable the Customer Lockbox feature. It requires Microsoft to get your approval for any datacenter operation that grants a Microsoft support engineer or other employee direct access to any of your data. For example, in some cases a Microsoft support engineer might need access to your Microsoft 365 content in order to help troubleshoot and fix an issue for you. Customer lockbox requests also have an expiration time, and content access is removed after the support engineer has fixed the issue.",
  "rationale": "Enabling this feature protects your data against data spillage and exfiltration.",
  "impact": "The impact associated with this setting is a requirement to grant Microsoft access to the tenant environment prior to a Microsoft engineer accessing the environment for support or troubleshooting.",
