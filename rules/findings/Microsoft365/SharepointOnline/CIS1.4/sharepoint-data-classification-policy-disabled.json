    "description":  "Consider to set up and use SharePoint Online data classification policies on data stored in your SharePoint Online sites.",
    "rationale":  "The policies will help categorize your most important data so you can effectively protect it from illicit access, and will help make it easier to investigate discovered breaches.",
    "impact":  "Creation of data classification policies will not cause a significant impact to an organization. However, ensuring long term adherence with policies can potentially be a significant training and ongoing compliance effort across an organization. Organizations should ensure that training and compliance planning is part of the classification policy creation process.",
