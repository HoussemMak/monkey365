    "rationale":  "The Azure Key Vault enables users to store and keep secrets within the Microsoft Azure environment. Secrets in the Azure Key Vault are octet sequences with a maximum size of 25k bytes each. The exp (expiration time) attribute identifies the expiration time on or after which the secret MUST NOT be used. By default, secrets never expire. It is thus recommended to rotate secrets in the key vault and set an explicit expiration time for all secrets. This ensures that the secrets cannot be used beyond their assigned lifetimes.",
    "impact":  "Secrets cannot be used beyond their assigned expiry times respectively. Secrets need to be rotated periodically wherever they are used.",
    "remediation": "
