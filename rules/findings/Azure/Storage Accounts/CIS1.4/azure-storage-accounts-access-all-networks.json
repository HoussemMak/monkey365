  "description": "Azure Storage provides a layered security model. This model enables administrators to secure storage accounts to a specific subset of networks. An administrator can limit access to your storage account to requests originating from specified IP addresses, IP ranges or from a list of subnets in Azure Virtual Networks.",
  "rationale": "Storage accounts should be configured to deny access to traffic from all networks (including internet traffic). Access can be granted to traffic from specific Azure Virtual networks, allowing a secure network boundary for specific applications to be built. Access can also be granted to public internet IP address ranges, to enable connections from specific internet or on-premises clients. When network rules are configured, only applications from allowed networks can access a storage account. When calling from an allowed network, applications continue to require proper authorization (a valid access key or SAS token) to access the storage account.",
