    "description":  "The Storage Table storage is a service that stores structure NoSQL data in the cloud, providing a key/attribute store with a schema less design. Storage Logging happens server-side and allows details for both successful and failed requests to be recorded in the storage account. These logs allow users to see the details of read, write, and delete operations against the tables. Storage Logging log entries contain the following information about individual requests: Timing information such as start time, end-to-end latency, and server latency, authentication details , concurrency information and the sizes of the request and response messages.",
    "rationale":  "Storage Analytics logs contain detailed information about successful and failed requests to a storage service. This information can be used to monitor individual requests and to diagnose issues with a storage service. Requests are logged on a best-effort basis.",
    "impact":  "Enabling storage account blob service logging does have a cost implication.",
