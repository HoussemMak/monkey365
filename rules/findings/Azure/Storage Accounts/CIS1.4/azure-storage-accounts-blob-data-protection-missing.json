Erroneously modified or deleted accidentally by an application or other storage account user cause data loss or data unavailability.  \r\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is recommended the Azure Storage be made recoverable by enabling **soft delete** configuration. This is to save and recover data when blobs or blob snapshots are deleted.\r\n\t",
  "rationale": "There could be scenarios where users accidentally run delete commands on Azure Storage blobs or blob snapshot or attacker/malicious user does it deliberately to cause disruption. Deleting an Azure Storage blob leads to immediate data loss / non-accessible data.  \r\n\t\t\t\t   There is a property of Azure Storage blob service to make recoverable blobs.\r\n\t\t\t\t   \r\n\t\t\t\t   * Soft Delete\r\n\t\t\t\t   Enabling this configuration for azure storage ensures that even if blobs/data were deleted from the storage account, Blobs/data objects remain recoverable for a particular time which set in the `Retention policies` [Retention policies can be 7 days to 365 days]\r\n\t\r\n\t",
