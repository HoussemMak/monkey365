  "description": "Read access permission was enabled for blobs",
  "rationale": "Anonymous, public read access to a container and its blobs can be enabled in Azure Blob storage. It grants read-only access to these resources without sharing the account key, and without requiring a shared access signature. It is recommended not to provide anonymous access to blob containers until, and unless, it is strongly desired. A shared access signature token should be used for providing controlled and timed access to blob containers. If no anonymous access is needed on the storage account, itâ€™s recommended to set allowBlobPublicAccess false.",
  "impact": "Access using shared access signatures will have to be managed.",
  "remediation": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t###### From Azure Console\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Go to `Storage Accounts`.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. For each storage account, go to `Containers` under **blob service**\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. For each container, click `Access policy`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4. Set `Public access level` to `Private (no anonymous access)`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5.
