    "description":  "Read access permission was enabled for blobs",
    "rationale":  "Anonymous, public read access to a container and its blobs can be enabled in Azure Blob storage. It grants read-only access to these resources without sharing the account key, and without requiring a shared access signature. It is recommended not to provide anonymous access to blob containers until, and unless, it is strongly desired. A shared access signature token should be used for providing controlled and timed access to blob containers. If no anonymous access is needed on the storage account, itâ€™s recommended to set allowBlobPublicAccess false.",
    "impact":  "Access using shared access signatures will have to be managed.",
    "remediation":  '
					###### From Azure Console

					5. For each storage account, go to `Allow Blob public access` in Configuration
					6. Set `Disabled` if no anonymous access is needed on the storage account
