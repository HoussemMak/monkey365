  "description": "Users who are set as subscription owners are able to make administrative changes to the subscriptions and move them into and out of Azure Active Directories.",
  "rationale": "Permissions to move subscriptions in and out of Microsoft Entra ID must only be given to appropriate administrative personnel. A subscription that is moved into an Microsoft Entra ID may be within a folder to which other users have elevated permissions. This prevents loss of data or unapproved changes of the objects within by potential bad actors.",
  "impact": "Subscriptions will need to have these settings turned off to be moved.",
