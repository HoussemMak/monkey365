  "description": "The storage account container containing the activity log export should not be publicly accessible.",
  "rationale": "Allowing public access to activity log content may aid an adversary in identifying weaknesses in the affected account's use or configuration.",
  "impact": "Configuring container `Access policy` to `private` will remove access from the container for everyone except owners of the storage account. Access policy needs to be set explicitly in order to allow access to other desired users.",
  "remediation": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t###### From Azure Console\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Go to `Activity log`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Select `Export`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Select `Subscription`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4. In section `Storage Account`, note the name of the Storage account\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5. Close the `Export Audit Logs` blade. Close the `Monitor - Activity Log` blade.\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6. In right column, Click service `Storage Accounts` to access Storage account blade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t7. Click on the storage account name noted in step 4. This will open blade specific to that storage account\r\n\t\t\t\t\t8. In Section `Blob Service` click `Containers`. It will list all the containers in next blade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t9. Look for a record with container named as `insight-operational-logs`. Click ... from right most column to open Context menu\r\n\t\t\t\t\t10. Click `Access Policy` from Context Menu and ensure `Public Access Level` is set to `Private (no anonymous access)`\r\n\r\n\t",
