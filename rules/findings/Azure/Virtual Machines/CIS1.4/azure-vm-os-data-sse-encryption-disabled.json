    "rationale":  "Encrypting the IaaS VM's OS disk (boot volume), Data disks (non-boot volume) ensures that the entire content is fully unrecoverable without a key and thus protects the volume from unwarranted reads. CMK is superior encryption although requires additional planning.",
    "impact":  "Using CMK/BYOK will entail additional management of keys.
				**NOTE**: You must have your key vault setup to utilize this.

					###### From Azure Console
					**Note**: Disks must be detached from VMs to have encryption changed.
					1. Go to `Virtual machines`
					2. For each virtual machine, go to `Settings`
					3. Click on `Disks`
					4. Click the `X` to detach the disk from the VM
					5. Now search for `Disks` and locate the unattached disk
					6. Click the disk then select `Encryption`
					7. Change your encryption type, then select your encryption set
					8. Click `Save`
					9. Go back to the VM and re-attach the disk
