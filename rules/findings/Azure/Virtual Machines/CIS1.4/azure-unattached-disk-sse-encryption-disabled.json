  "description": "Ensure that unattached disks in a subscription are encrypted with a Customer Managed Key (CMK).",
  "rationale": "Managed disks are encrypted by default with Platform-managed keys. Using Customer-managed keys may provide an additional level of security or meet an organization's regulatory requirements. Encrypting managed disks ensures that its entire content is fully unrecoverable without a key and thus protects the volume from unwarranted reads. Even if the disk is not attached to any of the VMs, there is always a risk where a compromised user account with administrative access to VM service can mount/attach these data disks which may lead to sensitive information disclosure and tampering.",
  "impact": "\r\n\t\t\t\tEncryption is available only on Standard tier VMs. This might cost you more.\r\n\t\t\t\tUtilizing and maintaining Customer-managed keys will require additional work to created, protect, and rotate keys.\r\n\t",
