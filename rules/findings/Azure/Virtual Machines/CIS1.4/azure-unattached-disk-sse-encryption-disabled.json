    "description":  "Ensure that unattached disks in a subscription are encrypted with a Customer Managed Key (CMK).",
    "rationale":  "Managed disks are encrypted by default with Platform-managed keys. Using Customer-managed keys may provide an additional level of security or meet an organization's regulatory requirements. Encrypting managed disks ensures that its entire content is fully unrecoverable without a key and thus protects the volume from unwarranted reads. Even if the disk is not attached to any of the VMs, there is always a risk where a compromised user account with administrative access to VM service can mount/attach these data disks which may lead to sensitive information disclosure and tampering.",
    "impact":  "
				Encryption is available only on Standard tier VMs. This might cost you more.
				Utilizing and maintaining Customer-managed keys will require additional work to created, protect, and rotate keys.
