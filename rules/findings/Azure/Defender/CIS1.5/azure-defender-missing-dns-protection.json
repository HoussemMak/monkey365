    "description":  "Microsoft Defender for DNS scans all network traffic exiting from within a subscription.",
	"rationale":  "DNS lookups within a subscription are scanned and compared to a dynamic list of websites that might be potential security threats. These threats could be a result of a security breach within your services, thus scanning for them could prevent a potential security threat from being introduced.",
    "impact":  "Enabling Microsoft Defender for DNS requires enabling Microsoft Defender for your subscription. Both will incur additional charges, with Defender for DNS being a small amount per million queries.",
    "remediation":  "
