  "description": "Turning on Microsoft Defender for Databases enables threat detection for the instances running your database software. This provides threat intelligence, anomaly detection, and behavior analytics in the Azure Microsoft Defender for Cloud. Instead of being enabled on services like Platform as a Service (PaaS), this implementation will run within your instances as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) on the Operating Systems hosting your databases.",
  "rationale": "Enabling Microsoft Defender for Azure SQL Databases allows your organization more granular control of the infrastructure running your database software. Instead of waiting on Microsoft release updates or other similar processes, you can manage them yourself. Threat detection is provided by the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC).",
  "impact": "Running Defender on Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) may incur increased costs associated with running the service and the instance it is on. Similarly, you will need qualified personnel to maintain the operating system and software updates. If it is not maintained, security patches will not be applied and it may be open to vulnerabilities.",
  "remediation": "\r\n\t\t\t\t\t###### From Azure Console\r\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Go to `Microsoft Defender for Cloud`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Select `Environment settings`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Click on the subscription name\r\n\t\t\t\t\t4. Select the `Defender plans` blade\r\n\t\t\t\t\t5. Review the chosen pricing tier. For the `Databases` resource type the radial button should be set to `On`\r\n\t\t\t\t\t6. Select `Save`\r\n\t",
