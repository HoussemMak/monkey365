  "description": "Microsoft Defender for Cosmos DB scans all incoming network requests for changes to your virtual machine.",
  "rationale": "In scanning Cosmos DB requests within a subscription, requests are compared to a heuristic list of potential security threats. These threats could be a result of a security breach within your services, thus scanning for them could prevent a potential security threat from being introduced.",
  "impact": "Enabling Microsoft Defender for Cosmos requires enabling Microsoft Defender for your subscription. Both will incur additional charges.",
