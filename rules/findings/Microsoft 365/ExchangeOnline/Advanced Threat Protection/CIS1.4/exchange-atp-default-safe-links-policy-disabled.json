    "description":  "Enabling the Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) Safe Links policy allows email messages that include URLs to be processed and rewritten if required. ATP Safe Links provides time of-click verification of web addresses in email messages and Office documents.",
    "rationale":  "ATP Safe Links extends phishing protection to include redirecting all email hyperlinks through a forwarding service which will block malicious ones even after the email has been delivered to the end user.",
    "impact":  "When enabling and configuring ATP Safe Links impact to the end-user should be low. Users should be informed of the change as, in the event a link is unsafe and blocked, they will receive a message that it has been blocked",
    "remediation":  '
					###### To enable the Safe Links policy, use the Microsoft 365 Admin Center
					1. Click `Security` to open the `Security portal`.
					2. Navigate to `Threat management` *>* `Policy` *>* `Safe Links`.
					3. Click `Create`, name the policy, and then click `Next`.
					4. Choose whether the policy will apply to `Users, Groups, or Domains` then select `Next`.
					5. Under `Protection settings` click `On - URLs will be rewritten and checked 
					against a list of known malicious links when user clicks on the link.`, select the same for Microsoft Teams.
					6. Click the following options - `Apply Safe Links to email messages sent within the organization, Do not let users click through to the original URL` then click Next.
					7. You may choose to use default or a custom text, then click `Next`.
					8. Click `Submit`.
					
					###### To enable the ATP Safe Links policy, use the Exchange Online PowerShell Module
					1. Connect to Exchange Online using `Connect-ExchangeOnline`
					2. Run the following PowerShell command:					
					```powershell
					$p = @{
						Name = "Monkey 365 all company";
						EnableSafeLinksForEmail = $true;
						EnableSafeLinksForTeams = $true;
						ScanUrls = $true;
						DeliverMessageAfterScan = $true;
						EnableForInternalSenders = $true;
						AllowClickThrough = $false;
					}
					New-SafeLinksPolicy @p
					```
					###### Once a new Safe Link policy is created, a new Safe Link rule should be set. 
					```powershell
					$p = @{
						Name = "Monkey 365 all company";
						SafeLinksPolicy = "Monkey 365 all company";
						RecipientDomainIs = "monkey365domain.com";
					}
					New-SafeLinksRule @p
					```
