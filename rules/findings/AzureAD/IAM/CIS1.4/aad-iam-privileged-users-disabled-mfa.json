    "description":  "Enable multi-factor authentication for all user credentials who have write access to Azure resources. These include roles like:
					
					* Service Co-Administrators
					* Subscription Owners
					* Contributors
					",
    "rationale":  "Multi-factor authentication requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. Multi-factor authentication provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With multi-factor authentication, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.",
    "impact":  "Users would require two forms of authentication before any action is granted. Also, this requires an overhead for managing dual forms of authentication.",
    "remediation":  "Follow Microsoft Azure documentation and setup multi-factor authentication in your environment.
