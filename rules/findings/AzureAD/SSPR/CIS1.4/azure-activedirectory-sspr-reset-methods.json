  "description": "Ensures that two alternate forms of identification are provided before allowing a password reset.",
  "rationale": "With a Self-service Password Reset (SSPR) that uses Azure Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) ensures the user's identity is confirmed using two separate methods of identification. With multiple methods set, an attacker would have to compromise both methods before they could maliciously reset a user's password.",
  "impact": "There may be administrative overhead as users who lose access to their secondary authentication methods will need an administrator with permissions to remove it. There will also need to be an organization wide security policy and training to teach administrators to verify the identity of the requesting user, so that social engineering can not render this setting useless.",
