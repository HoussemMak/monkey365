    "description":  "Microsoft Azure creates a default bad password policy that is already applied to Azure administrative and normal user accounts. This is not applied to user accounts that are synced from an on-premise Active Directory unless Microsoft Entra ID Connect is used and you enable EnforceCloudPasswordPolicyForPasswordSyncedUsers. Please see the list in default values on the specifics of this policy.",
    "rationale":  "Enabling this gives your organization further customization on what secure passwords are allowed. Setting a bad password list enables your organization to fine-tune its password policy further, depending on your needs. Removing easy-to-guess passwords increases the security of access to your Azure resources.",
    "impact":  "Increasing needed password complexity might increase overhead on administration of user account.",
    "remediation":  "
