    "description":  "Azure Active Directory Identity Protection sign-in risk detects risks in real-time and offline. A risky sign-in is an indicator for a sign-in attempt that might not have been performed by the legitimate owner of a user account.",
    "rationale":  "Turning on the sign-in risk policy ensures that suspicious sign-ins are challenged for multi-factor authentication.",
    "impact":  "When the policy triggers, the user will need MFA to access the account. In the case of a user who hasn't registered MFA on their account, they would be blocked from accessing their account. It is therefore recommended that the MFA registration policy be configured for all users who are a part of the Sign-in Risk policy.",
