**Note**: Default value is ```AzurePublic```

 ```-Instance```

Specifies the cloud provider to use. Valid values are:

* Azure

 ```-TenantID```

It can be used to force Monkey365 to sign in to a tenant

```-ResolveTenantDomainName```

```-ExcludePlugin```
This option can be used to exclude plugins from being executed. For example, there are situations when you may need to exclude an specific plugin, for example in tenants with thousands of users/mailboxed, that would slow down the scan.

``` powershell
$param = @{
    Instance = 'Microsoft365';
    Analysis = 'ExchangeOnline';
    PromptBehavior = 'SelectAccount';
    TenantID = '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000';
	ExcludePlugin = exo0003, exo0004, exo0005;
    ExportTo = 'HTML';
}
Invoke-Monkey365 @param
```
